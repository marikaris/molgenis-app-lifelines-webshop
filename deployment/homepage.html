        <h3>Welcome at the Lifelines Data Catalogue!</h3>
        <p>Lifelines continuously collects data. The Lifelines Data Catalogue provides an overview of all collected data in Lifelines already available for researchers to request. These data becomes accessible to researchers after some quality checks. A <a href="https://www.lifelines.nl/researcher/biobank-lifelines/data-and-samples" target="_blank">timeline of data collection</a> can be found on our website.</p>
        <p>By clicking the '<a href="https://lifelines.accept.molgenis.org/@molgenis-experimental/molgenis-app-lifelines-webshop/dist/index.html#/">Catalogue</a>' button you can browse all available data items from questionnaires, measurements and (blood and urine) sample analyses that are already available for researchers to request. Regularly, new data will be released and added to the data catalogue.</p>
        <p>Researchers wanting to submit an application for data from the Lifelines biobank can request the data via the catalogue. If you want to create, save and/ or submit your data selection, you need to register first. Subsequently, you are able to create your data selection and submit the data selection together with your research proposal. If you also want to request existing samples for bioanalysis, please contact the Lifelines Research Office (<a href="mailto:research@lifelines.nl">research@lifelines.nl</a>).</p>
        <p>More information on the <a href="https://www.lifelines.nl/researcher/biobank-lifelines/application-process" target="_blank">application process</a> for access to Lifelines data and samples can be found on our website. For questions regarding the catalogue or submission of your proposal, please contact the Lifelines Research Office (<a href="mailto:research@lifelines.nl">research@lifelines.nl</a>).</p>
